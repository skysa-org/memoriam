	// Android 15 an app cannot paint it: it is transparent over the app's

	// Android 17, 2026-10-11; a light one was a pale bar under the app in dark
	// mode). A deployment that gives the two one colour has one bar on every
	// phone. The page cannot paint the bar itself: Chrome lays an installed
	// app out between the system bars, with no inset for the page to fill
	// (`WebappIntentDataProvider.ColorProviderImpl.getNavigationBarColor`,
	// `CustomTabNavigationBarController`, `WebappActivity.getBackgroundDrawable`
